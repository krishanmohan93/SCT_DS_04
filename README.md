## Features
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Reads and preprocesses accident data.
   - Handles missing values, duplicate entries, and checks for data consistency.

2. **Analysis**:
   - **Time-of-Day Analysis**: Identifies accident patterns based on the time of day.
   - **Weather and Road Conditions**: Evaluates the impact of weather and road conditions on accident severity.
   - **Twilight and Nighttime Analysis**: Examines the role of visibility in accidents.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Bar charts illustrating accident distributions by road conditions, weather, and light conditions.
   - Heatmap visualization for identifying accident hotspots.

4. **Interactive Mapping**:
   - Uses Folium to generate an interactive map displaying accident densities based on latitude and longitude.
